  <h1>CSS Flex & Grid</h1>
  <p>
    This book takes a completely different approach. I won't teach you the things flex and grid can do. Instead, I will first show you some components and layouts and make you think how to build them using the CSS concepts you already know. Now you have a problem, and you want a solution.
